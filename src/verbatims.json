        "text": "**Why Vote for Elizabeth Warren**\nâ€‹\nElizabeth's supporters come from many different backgrounds and walks of life, and each has their own personal reasons for supporting her campaign.  However, since you asked, we'd like to provide a few points for you, along with suggestions for further reading.  Hopefully, you'll find something you like!\nâ€‹\n*She Has a Plan for That*\nâ€‹\nElizabeth has the most comprehensive and exhaustively researched and defended set of policy plans of any of the current candidates.  Whether your biggest concern is [immigration](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/immigration), or our [childrens' education](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/public-education), whether it's [criminal justice reform](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/criminal-justice-reform) or [veterans' affairs](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/promises-to-veterans), or perhaps [health care](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/health-care), [diversity and inclusiveness](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/disability-rights), or even the [fundamental health of our democracy itself](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/strengthening-democracy) -- if you're worried about it, she probably has a plan for it.\nâ€‹\nTo learn more about Elizabeth's plans, you can [visit her website](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans), or just ask me!  To know about a specific plan, you can ask something like `!WarrenPlanBot immigration reform` or, to get a list of all the plans, try `!WarrenPlanBot show me the plans`.\nâ€‹\n*She Fights Hard for You*\nâ€‹\nElizabeth was instrumental in the creation of the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/making-sense/what-is-the-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-anyway), which was formed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to protect the financial interests of working Americans against the predation of big capital.  After Wall Street's heavy opposition lead Republicans to block her confirmation to the Bureau she helped create, she made the decision to run for Senator so she could fight entrenched corporate interests where they lay.  Upon her election she received a seat on the Senate Banking Committee which she continued to use to hold big capital accountable for its actions and defend the financial rights of every American, pushing for the enforcement of Dodd-Frank regulations and the criminal prosecution of executives at big banks who abuse their positions by [ending the Too Big To Jail Act](https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2019.4.2%20Ending%20Too%20Big%20to%20Jail%20Summary.pdf) and introducing the [Corporate Executive Accountability Act](https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2019.4.1%20Corporate%20Executive%20Accountability%20Act%20Summary.pdf).\nâ€‹\n*She Refuses Dirty Money*\nâ€‹\nElizabeth's campaign is heavily funded by small donors like yourself.  She has refused to take any money from PACs or registered lobbyists and has turned away from holding fundrasing events for big money donors, preferring to build a true grassroots movement which does not leave her beholden to interests other than those of the American public.  Most recently, she has pledged [not to take large donations](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/my-plan-for-getting-big-money-out-of-politics-9819aec4240c) from executives at big tech companies, banks, equity firms, or hedge funds.  This focus on small donors has been massively successful:  she raised [almost $25 million](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/an-update-on-our-q3-fundraising-numbers-4b290e7e9d80) in the third quarter of 2019 alone, and none of it money from any special interests.\nâ€‹\n*Hear More from the Community*\nâ€‹\nThere are plenty more reasons to support Elizabeth.  In /r/ElizabethWarren a user put together [this phenomenal post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElizabethWarren/comments/cjcguc/the_case_for_warren_from_the_left/) which details many reasons to join the campaign.  If you have more questions, feel free to [join the converation there](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElizabethWarren/) and ask about anything that may be on your mind.
