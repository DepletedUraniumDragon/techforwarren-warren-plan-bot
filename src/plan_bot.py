You can call me like this:  
`!WarrenPlanBot [plan_topic]`  
and Iâ€™ll reply with the plan she has for that.

For example, if you wanted to learn about Elizabethâ€™s plan for immigration reform, you could write  
`!WarrenPlanBot immigration reform`

You can even be a little more conversational if youâ€™d like, and say  
`!WarrenPlanBot what is her plan for ending private prisons?`

Iâ€™ll do my best to find the correct plan, but sometimes I have to guess, which means I might make mistakes (Iâ€™m just a bot!). Iâ€™ll get better, though, as I learn more about the topics that matter to you most ðŸ˜„

To see my full list of Elizabethâ€™s plans, you can use the command: `!WarrenPlanBot show me the plans`  
To display this help: `!WarrenPlanBot help`
For advanced usage: `!WarrenPlanBot advanced help`

I hope to see you around!
