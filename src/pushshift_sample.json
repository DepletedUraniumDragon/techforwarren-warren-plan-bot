The one area I think Bernie  absolutely **dominates** where Warren doesn't, [is with rhetoric](https://youtu.be/QThknQs-gIc).  They both are offering tons of plans, but to me Bernie is the only  candidate with a strong message of how it will all be executed. If you  want to implement even a fraction of either Warren's or Bernie's plans  you need a radical change in voter engagement in this country, and I  have **never** seen a  politician who can rally young people and apathetic people into the  political process as well as Bernie has. In 2015 he was nothing but a  small Independent Senator from Vermont, and he went on to win 23  contests against the establishment backed former First Lady, Secretary  of State, and Senator of New York. Now he is arguably one of the most  popular politicians in America, and he has changed the political  rhetoric among leading Democrats. Just look at the incredibly  influential organizations that stemmed out of his 2016 campaign:\n\n* [Justice Democrats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Democrats)\n* [Brand New Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_New_Congress)\n* [Our Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Revolution)",

            "body": "# On to answering the question. How is Elizabeth Warren a protectionist (economic nationalist, as scary as that word is)? \n\nOn trade, Warren is closer to Donald Trump than Barrack Obama. She is actually very similar to Trump. \n\nHer trade plan is very big, so I'm just going to go for some highlights. \n\nWarren\u2019s plans list nine separate criteria a country would have to meet before negotiating a trade deal with the U.S. Those standards include upholding and enforcing the labor rights[ laid out by ](https://www.ilo.org/global/standards/introduction-to-international-labour-standards/conventions-and-recommendations/lang--en/index.htm)the International Labour Organization, eliminating all domestic fossil fuel subsidies, fulfilling commitments from the Paris Climate Agreement, not running afoul of the State Department\u2019s Country Reports on Human Rights, and not being on the Treasury Department\u2019s monitoring list for manipulative currency practices. These would be applied not only to new trade deals but to existing ones which would be renegotiated. Warren herself acknowledged that the USA doesn't even meet her own standards.\n\nNow let me say that in an ideologically perfect world, these would be some great standards. However, in the current world situation, the implications of this would be disastrous. To start, we would have to halt trade with almost every country we currently trade with. If that doesn't make you lol then somethings wrong with you. \n\nWarren\u2019s suggestions to reform the trade negotiation process sound noble but would sabotage any set of negotiations. Her proposal to publish every trade agreement draft is a surefire way to scare off partners who prefer to negotiate quietly before introducing a final draft. Her suggestions for congressional participation are likely to stymie the ratification of any deal even further. And don\u2019t get me started on her border adjustment tax for carbon. The fact that Warren\u2019s proposal barely mentions the World Trade Organization is damning. (this is taken from [this WaPo article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/07/30/elizabeth-warrens-trade-plan-is-bad-politics-worse-policy/?utm_term=.993b03c70bb9)).\n\n[After analyzing Warren's plan, the CATO Institute](https://ielp.worldtradelaw.net/2019/07/warrens-trade-policy-agenda.html) reasoned that there would be no trade deals under the Warren administration (most likely). The sad part about this is that because of these strict standards and protectionist policies, the world would likely [bypass the United States](https://www.piie.com/commentary/op-eds/china-cutting-tariffs-everyone-else) and [increase trade without us.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-mercosur-reach-agreement-on-trade-11561745957) This is what happened under the Trump administration. So, in short, Trump and Warren implemented protectionism from two different angles but are likely to get the same negative results. \n\nWarren would also attempt to impose a \u201cborder carbon adjustment\u201d \u2014 an additional fee on imports made with carbon-intensive processes. This is bad economics and is essentially a tariff. We all know that tariffs are just taxes on the consumers. Trump tried tariffs and they didn't work.  Warren also wrote that she would only seek expedited trade authority after unanimous approval from labor, consumer, rural and regional advisory committees and would let more congressional committees review such authority. These reforms would significantly slow the trade negotiation process but also bring in voices that Warren believes have been excluded from the process. I won't go in to it now, but its debatable whether these voices were excluded in the first place or even if they need to be included. Regardless of the not clear benefits of this, it would slow trade negotiations even further when coupled with the 9 criteria she has set. \n\nWarren's trade plan is so similar to Donald Trump that Tucker Carlson offered open praise for it.\n\n \u201cShe sounds like Donald Trump at his best,\u201d[ he said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUW8kbZyucI) on his show in a monologue that caught the attention of Trump\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\n[Warren also likes tariffs. A lot. As much as Trump.](https://www.axios.com/elizabeth-warren-support-trump-tariffs-china-4c70a663-8558-4997-a92d-75fd583919a6.html) That is bad. I shouldn't have to explain why tariffs are bad. Like REALLY bad. [Tariffs are terrible taxes.](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/07/31/why-tariffs-are-bad-taxes)\n\n[Warren's corporate tax plan is also bad.](https://www.vox.com/2019/4/11/18305108/elizabeth-warren-real-corporate-tax) Actually, this might sound surprising, but corporate taxes are bad. They are just taxes on the consumer. There are many better ways to get corporations to pay their fair share without hurting the consumer. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could go on, but I'm gonna wrap this up. Warren's \"economic patriotism\" plan is more protectionist than Donald Trump, because of her strict standards and addition of incredible amounts of national bureaucracy. She wants to implement all sorts of tariffs and tariff-like taxes and plans to protect the american people by... making them pay more for goods and services (because she wants to enforce corporate taxes instead of get rid of them). She has received praise from the same people who praised Trump's economic plan. That should be a red flag. \n\nShe is a protectionist and protectionism is bad. There are issues with globalism (and she highlights some valid concerns in regards to human rights and climate change), but protectionism and insane bureaucracy is *not the way to go*. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurther reading: [here](https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/elizabeth-warren-terrible-plans/) [here](https://www.cato.org/blog/senator-warrens-protectionist-misleading-trade-plan-rhetoric)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNOTE part 2: This is a quick rundown just highlighting some key issues. There is a lot more to it than just this. Hope I'm more clear on why Warren is a protectionist!",

Urban communities and rural ones require different solutions, both of which Elizabeth Warren has a plan for.\n\nFor me, her message has been perfect for bringing people of all races, genders, and socioeconomic status together, unless you're one of the people in the socioeconomic class that currently acts as the oppressor of everyone else.

I think Bernie's positions attack the upper middle class too much and Elizabeth generally focuses her sights on the top 1% only. In a general election that matters. Saying you're going to tax every single stock trade as Bernie has regardless of network means that even middle class workers with a 401k will be hit. A wealth tax on wealth over 50 million meanwhile spares all but the uber wealthy and there will be no question among the middle and upper middle class that they won't be affected by it. Think how this election will be won -  the well to do suburbs where educated whites have voted GOP previously but are turned off to Trump. Touch their money and they will run back to the GOP. Only Warren has a comprehensive plan to make the wealthy pay their fair share without sounding like she wants to blow up the system and make anyone making over $50K annually pay more in taxes like Bernie.",

            "body": "BP here, let me add a little context.  Back in the day, I joined in 2009, we used to have a lot of VRs, voluntary returns.  That meant that if you were apprehended at the border, you just sign a document admitting your Mexican, crossed the border illegally and just want to go back. Basically a slap in the wrist and maybe they should try to cross legally.   VRs were the bread and butter.  We would issue ERs (expedited removals) if someone had crossed so many times, like 10 or more times.  At that point they're not trying to cross legally any which way.  Or issue ERs if they had a criminal record.  Under Obama that policy changed.  ERs were handed out to everyone, even a first time crosser.  And we would issue a Reinstate for even the second time.  Reinstatements are 20 year removals as opposed to ER's 5 years.  Criminal prosecutions for border crossings are very rare.  They are almost always reserved for those with prior criminal convictions.  So to \"decriminalize\" border crossings isn't saying much.\n\nWe don't necessarily need to get rid of ERs.  You think the immigration system is bogged down now?  Wait until every single apprehension has to wait for a court date instead of going back to Mexico the same or next day.  Unless we're talking actual \"open borders\", where we literally just let people cross undocumented.  But then what?  Do we just leave people out in the desert?  \n\nThis also doesn't really address the current issue.  When we pick someone up at the border, they are transported to the station.  Once at the station we run their biometrics.  Once we have that we figure out what to do.  Either way, the BP agents have some paperwork to do.  The WA/NTA is one of the easiest cases to do, and that's what all asylum seekers fall under, but even then your talking about hundreds of cases per day, and only 5 or 6 agents per shift to do them.  That's the real crisis on the border.  The Border Patrol stations are NOT equipped to handle the load they're seeing right now.  Part of Warren's plan should include what we do with asylum seekers from the moment they're picked up by Border Patrol, because this is the bottle neck.  As it is right now, they must pass through Border Patrol before anything else happens.  Maybe create another agency, or expand one, to take asylum seekers straight from BP before they even have to go to the station.  Or get BP better facilities, and more personnel to handle those facilities and paperwork.  \n\nI say this as someone who fully supports Warren, and have donated to her campaign, but we need to solve the issue of what happens to asylum seekers when they are picked up by Border Patrol, and I'm not seeing that here.\n\n Maybe there's more to it than what I'm seeing.  I'm 100% on board with everything else I've seen from Warren.  Bring on the immigration reform, it's badly needed.  We should be welcoming the people that want to contribute to our society.  I love Elizabeth Warren and she is far and away my first choice this election cycle, but this is the first plan I've seen from her that doesn't seem as well thought out.  She will need to address what she means by getting rid of ERs and decriminalizing the border.",

There\u2019s so much more we should do. Start with the wealth tax. Come on. Start with universal child care and education and investment in education from zero on through college. Let\u2019s see what that starts to do. Do the student loan debt forgiveness and that\u2019ll start to close the black and white wealth gap. Use my housing plan and attack redlining straight on. Help close the differences between the poorest in this country and the middle class. Give people more opportunities. Let\u2019s get everybody on board and try that.\n\nUBI, to me, is an end goal after setting up our social safety nets. I feel like without those we are potentially feeding into a corrupt system as people's UBI could potentially become the target of predatory company practices. What turns me off of Yang's proposal for UBI is it sounds like he wants to wind away a lot social safety nets in order for UBI to work and that gives me a lot of pause. \n\nThe truth is we don't have a lot of data to know what the effects or best practices of UBI are and I think we need more information before we plunge the whole nation into untested waters. I've got my eyes on Hawaii as they have been looking into ways to implement UBI and the only other program I know of was in Ontario but that go cancelled by the incoming right wing party leaders. \n\nI think UBI can work, I want it to be a workable system because I think it could be helpful in preventing poverty more effectively than the piecemeal systems we currently have but I don't think it's a strong enough issue to be a federal problem at this point. We should be looking for local economies and city/state governments to look into this first before we start scaling things up.",

            "body": "Well, [the idea](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2019/04/24/how-progressive-is-senator-elizabeth-warrens-loan-forgiveness-proposal/) comes from the Brookings Institute, and basically points out that through income-based repayment options, those making very little money aren't actually going to repay the full value of their loans.  They'll pay a lesser payment for 20 (or 25) years and have the rest of their debt forgiven, so forgiving it more quickly is only worth the amount they would have paid under the REPAYE program.  They then recalculate the benefits by quintile and the top 20% is getting 27% of the benefit instead of 18%.  If you do the same with Bernie's plan, the amount will grow similarly.\n\nFor people that took out way more debt than their education is worth, $50k is still significant, but they should probably already be using the REPAYE option.  They're essentially already enrolled in a loan forgiveness program that will forgive most of their debt (minus the income-based payments).  \n\nSure, full forgiveness would be better for them, as it would save those lowered payments, but as soon as you open it up to an instantaneous valuation and payment, all of those doctors and investment bankers (who as Brooking shows will be getting much more benefit than the REPAYE recipients) just need to negotiate a temporary salary reduction, cash in, and go right back to earning $250k.  The $50k limit both covers most borrowers (75% are fully forgiven), but also limits the benefits of gaming the system.  Most of them would need to take more than a $50k salary reduction to qualify for the full value.\n\nThe simple fact is that these plans already benefit the well-off more than the poor, and while there are some cases of people with extreme debt who don't have the corresponding careers, most do, and full forgiveness exacerbates the racial wealth gap.  Adding $1T to the cost of a program to both mostly benefit the wealthy and to further increase the wealth gap is a bad plan.\n\nIt's not like Warren and her team didn't consider this option or is adverse to big cost plans for the public good, it's that the full forgiveness implementation actually makes other problems worse.",

            "body": "I didn't see a paywall.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Juli\u00e1n Castro will stand between Cory Booker and Tim Ryan at Miami\u2019s Adrienne Arsht Center for the first Democratic presidential debate of the 2020 campaign cycle.\n\nI\u2019ll be paying special attention, however, to the former San Antonio mayor\u2019s interactions with the candidate to Booker\u2019s immediate left, Elizabeth Warren, for any subtle, borderline-imperceptible hints on how they vibe together.\n\nWarren, the two-term Massachusetts senator and progressive hero, is surging in the polls right now. A Monmouth University poll of national Democratic voters, conducted from June 12-17, found Warren in second place, behind former Vice President Joe Biden, at 15 percent. That represents a nine-point jump since April, easily the biggest growth spurt for any Democratic candidate.\n\nAt a time when Biden finds himself answering for a wide range of controversial statements and legislative actions over the course of his half-century political career, Warren is positioning herself as the party\u2019s most credible anti-Biden: someone who shares Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 critiques of the way our economic system breeds extreme opportunity disparities, but brings more texture to the argument.\n\nUnlike Sanders, she doesn\u2019t hesitate to call herself a capitalist. She simply believes that when capitalism gets corrupted by powerful interests, the government needs to step in and redress the imbalance.\n\nWarren is important to Castro for reasons that go beyond the mutual admiration society they\u2019ve recently formed.\n\nLast month, Warren praised Castro\u2019s \u201cPeople First\u201d immigration plan during an interview with MSNBC host Lawrence O\u2019Donnell. She followed up the interview by tweeting, \u201cI admire (Castro\u2019s) smart ideas on reforming our immigration laws. We should all pay attention to them.\u201d\n\nCastro responded in kind, tweeting, \u201cThanks for the shout out, @ewarren. You\u2019re setting the pace on policy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not an insult to Castro\u2019s earnest presidential campaign to say that his best prospect during the 2020 election cycle is the VP slot on the party\u2019s national ticket. And his best bet to get that nod would come from Warren, for reasons that involve the inevitably crass calculus of identity politics.\n\nIf any of the Democrats\u2019 top male contenders \u2014 such as Biden, Sanders and Pete Buttigieg \u2014 get the presidential nomination, they will give extra consideration, when it comes to picking a running mate, to female candidates.\n\nIt\u2019ll be a natural reaction to the growing power of women in Democratic politics, which manifested itself in a 2018 midterm that resulted in a record 106 Democratic women in Congress. It\u2019ll also be an acknowledgment of the power of the #MeToo movement \u2014 and the corresponding national exasperation with the way white men have dominated our politics.\n\nMost likely, Castro would only get serious consideration for the VP position if a woman wins the Democratic presidential nomination. At the moment, Warren seems to have the best chance of making that a reality.\n\nIf we accept the idea that presidential nominees want a running mate who\u2019ll balance the ticket, Castro would provide balance in almost every conceivable way: region, gender, age (Warren will be 71 on election day in 2020, while Castro will be 46) and ethnicity.\n\nContrary to the suspicions of his detractors, Castro didn\u2019t enter the 2020 presidential scrum as a way of angling for a VP offer. In fact, the reason he decided to run for president is that he didn\u2019t like being in the passive role of waiting three years ago for that phone call from Hillary Clinton.\n\nNonetheless, Castro\u2019s presidential campaign has made him a substantially stronger running-mate option this time around than he would have been for Clinton. In a sense, he\u2019s been vetted by the campaign trail, demonstrating an ability to think on the fly, communicate with town-hall audiences in various parts of the country and roll out serious policy initiatives.\n\nHe looks and sounds like a real presidential candidate, something that wouldn\u2019t have been obvious until he put himself out there as a candidate.\n\nThe virtues of his candidacy, however, haven\u2019t translated to the polls, where he\u2019s mired in the bottom tier of candidates, around 1 percent in most national polls. In the latest University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll, he was tied for seventh in his home state, with only 3 percent support.\n\nHe would be ideal for Warren, however, because he would be a loyal, articulate salesman for the ticket who wouldn\u2019t overshadow the presidential nominee. He also would add a degree of subject-matter expertise on some key issues: immigration, housing and pre-kindergarten education.\n\nIf it\u2019s possible to run for president and audition for vice president at the same time, that\u2019s what Castro will be doing on Wednesday night.",

            "body": "Outline Link: [https://outline.com/q4x56g](https://outline.com/q4x56g) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTHERE IS A revealing tradition of apostasy in American politics. Ronald Reagan\u2019s disingenuous claim never to have left the Democratic Party (\u201cIt left me\u201d) helped him woo millions of blue-collar Democrats. Hillary Clinton\u2019s decision to downplay her early Republicanism, by contrast, signalled her lack of ambition to win votes from the other side. That Donald Trump switched camps at least five times before entering the Republican primary suggested his disloyalty to any party. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s gravitation from right to left, and the use she is making of it in her increasingly fancied presidential campaign, is another telling case.\n\nUnlike Mrs Clinton, she is leaning into her Republican past. Her stump speech, which Lexington heard in a sun-dappled New Hampshire garden last week, opens with a description of her conservative upbringing in Oklahoma: her three brothers in uniform, her frugal parents. It testifies to her experience, rare in a former Harvard law professor, of working-class concerns and the heartland, even if she escaped both long ago. Yet she remained a registered Republican into her late 40s.\n\nMany Democrats would find that embarrassing. Yet Ms Warren, who entered politics over a decade later, after making a name for herself as a critic of Wall Street after the financial crisis, has no need to prove her left-wing credentials. She has used her conversion story to help distinguish herself from Bernie Sanders, her rival on the left, and to try to broaden her appeal.\n\nShe stuck with the Republicans, she has said, because she believed their claim to be the best market managers. Unlike the socialist from Vermont, she says she is a \u201ccapitalist to my bones\u201d. She left the right after researching surging individual bankruptcies, which turned out to be caused not by fecklessness, but ill health and other misfortunes. Why were so many hardworking people like her parents living so precariously? she asked. And why were companies, their soaring profits suggested, more protected?\n\nLike Mr Sanders, she considers the economy to be not merely skewed, but rigged in the corporate interest. Stagnant wages, rising economic insecurity, outsourced jobs are a product of \u201cwho government works for\u201d, she said in New Hampshire. But where Mr Sanders promises a revolution, her proposals are more measured, detailed and various. Indeed Ms Warren, who in a couple of recent polls was ahead of Mr Sanders, in second place behind Joe Biden, has unveiled more policies than her main rivals put together.\n\nHer signature proposal is a wealth tax of two cents on the dollar on assets over $50m. She optimistically claims this would raise $2.75trn in a decade, a windfall she would splurge on progressive priorities including universal free childcare, free public college fees and writing off college debt. That is Sanders-esque, with a tonal difference. Unlike Mr Sanders, whose recent entry into the \u201cmillionaire class\u201d seems not to have lessened his dislike of rich people, Ms Warren claims not to begrudge them their success. She just wants them to chip in more (\u201cTwo cents\u2014just two cents!\u201d is one of her slogans) to help expand opportunity (which is another).\n\nBelieve that or not, her other main proposals are regulatory fixes that are far-reaching and radical but mostly within the Democratic mainstream. Channelling the spirit of her hero Theodore Roosevelt, she vows to curb lobbying, campaign-finance extravagance, carbon emissions and much else. She has hedged her support for Mr Sanders\u2019s promise of Medicare for all.\n\nSetting aside the merits of her proposals, her focus on policy is clever politics, and unusual. Mrs Clinton\u2019s loss to a candidate with no serious policies, though she had reams of them, has deterred most Democratic candidates from issuing detailed proposals. Mr Biden, the front-runner, has two policies, including a cut-and-paste climate plan. Ms Warren apprehends that Mrs Clinton failed not because she had too many policies, but because she had no theme to make sense of them. Her commitment to saving capitalism from the capitalists is an answer to that.\n\nHer wonkishness also helps her deal with specific weaknesses. It has revised her former image as a one-trick pony, banging on about Wall Street. It has moderated her reputation as a left-winger. It has made Mr Sanders look lightweight by comparison. It has also helped neutralise an impression, exacerbated by sexism no doubt, that she is rather hectoring. \u201cShe reminds me of my sister-in-law,\u201d said one of her listeners in New Hampshire guiltily. \u201cBut she knows what she\u2019s talking about.\u201d Mrs Clinton\u2019s supporters were often unwilling to acknowledge her weaknesses as a campaigner. If Ms Warren\u2019s are more willing, it is because she also has strengths.\n\nShe may well supplant Mr Sanders as the main threat to Mr Biden from the left. Whether she could woo enough moderate voters to mount a serious challenge is harder to predict. It is certainly possible. Yet such voters are mainly concerned with beating Mr Trump, and may consider Ms Warren too left-wing for that, which would be reasonable. Or they might consider her too like Mrs Clinton, as a woman in her 60s, which would not be.\n\n## The sin of apostasy\n\nThat suggests Ms Warren\u2019s ideas may get less attention than they deserve on the left. Meanwhile they are being studied by reform-minded Republicans, grappling with the rejection of conservative verities that Mr Trump represents. Tucker Carlson of Fox News described Ms Warren\u2019s industrial policy as \u201clike Donald Trump at his best\u201d. Senator Marco Rubio wrote a column applauding its aims, while concluding that a \u201cradical progressive movement\u201d would not fulfil them. This illustrates a paradoxical feature of the political divide: a combination of intellectual flux and partisan rigidity.\n\nDespite her past Republicanism, Ms Warren could not win votes on the right without repudiating her party in some way; by opposing mass immigration, for example. Yet her critique of American capitalism is quietly inspiring conservative thinkers. It is an odd time, when ideas cross parties more easily than people.",

I would, though, like to point out exactly how intelligent and impressive she is. This isn't a knock on Buttigieg, but his father was a professor, so it was kind of born into educational privilege. Warren was from a working class family at a time when a woman from Oklahoma wasn't expected to attend college. [This article](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2019/06/22/for-young-elizabeth-warren-fire-cracker-questioner-debate-was-ticket-another-life/WGymidhp283BpvMAewZMPN/story.html) points out how her debate scholarship was her ticket out. Despite dropping out of college for a while, she returned after having children and went to law school. That's impressive. Anyway, Warren has been doing a great job of explaining her history. This isn't necessarily the most \"inspiring\", but definitely [gripping](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/03/19/childhood-financial-problems-mom-dress-story-elizabeth-warren-town-hall-sot-vpx.cnn) talking about her family, and does an awesome job of relating it to how economic inequality. It still makes me emotional hearing it again. Anyway, when you hear Liz speak, you feel like she is genuinely fighting for you because she's been there too, and because she cares, she has a plan to fix it. That's pretty inspiring to me. She's come a long way in her approach, I think. It's impressive to see how much she's continued to grow as a person into middle adulthood, which you can't say about a lot of people. \n\n\nAnyway, in regards to GMOs, I don't really care all that much, but for those that do, why not label them? It's not something I've put a lot of thought into, but that's my take. \n\nI hope this is helpful!",

            "body": "THERE IS a revealing tradition of apostasy in American politics. Ronald Reagan's disingenuous claim never to have left the Democratic Party (\"It left me\") helped him woo millions of bluecollar Democrats. Hillary Clinton's decision to downplay her early Republicanism, by contrast, signalled her lack of ambition to win votes from the other side. That Donald Trump switched camps at least five times before entering the Republican primary suggested his disloyalty to any party. Elizabeth Warren's gravitation from right to left, and the use she is making of it in her increasingly fancied presidential campaign, is another telling case.\n\nUnlike Mrs Clinton, she is leaning into her Republican past. Her stump speech, which Lexington heard in a sun-dappled New Hampshire garden last week, opens with a description of her conservative upbringing in Oklahoma: her three brothers in uniform, her frugal parents. It testifies to her experience, rare in a former Harvard law professor, of working-class concerns and the heartland, even if she escaped both long ago. Yet she remained a registered Republican into her late 40s.\n\nMany Democrats would find that embarrassing. Yet Ms Warren, who entered politics over a decade later, after making a name for herself as a critic of Wall Street after the financial crisis, has no need to prove her left-wing credentials. She has used her conversion story to help distinguish herself from Bernie Sanders, her rival on the left, and to try to broaden her appeal.\n\nShe stuck with the Republicans, she has said, because she believed their claim to be the best market managers. Unlike the socialist from Vermont, she says she is a \"capitalist to my bones\". She left the right after researching surging individual bankruptcies, which turned out to be caused not by fecklessness, but ill health and other misfortunes. Why were so many hardworking people like her parents living so precariously? she asked. And why were companies, their soaring profits suggested, more protected?\n\nLike Mr Sanders, she considers the economy to be not merely skewed, but rigged in the corporate interest. Stagnant wages, rising economic insecurity, outsourced jobs are a product of \"who government works for\", she said in New Hampshire. But where Mr Sanders promises a revolution, her proposals are more measured, detailed and various. Indeed Ms Warren, who in a couple of recent polls was ahead of Mr Sanders, in second place behind Joe Biden, has unveiled more policies than her main rivals put together.\n\nHer signature proposal is a wealth tax of two cents on the dollar on assets over $5om. She optimistically claims this would raise $2.75trn in a decade, a windfall she would splurge on progressive priorities including universal free childcare, free public college fees and writing off college debt. That is Sanders-esque, with a tonal difference. Unlike Mr Sanders, whose recent entry into the \"millionaire class\" seems not to have lessened his dislike of rich people, Ms Warren claims not to begrudge them their success. She just wants them to chip in more (\"Two cents-just two cents!\" is one of her slogans) to help expand opportunity (which is another).\n\nBelieve that or not, her other main proposals are regulatory fixes that are far-reaching and radical but mostly within the Democratic mainstream. Channelling the spirit of her hero Theodore Roosevelt, she vows to curb lobbying, campaign-finance extravagance, carbon emissions and much else. She has hedged her support for Mr Sanders's promise of Medicare for all.\n\nSetting aside the merits of her proposals, her focus on policy is clever politics, and unusual. Mrs Clinton's loss to a candidate with no serious policies, though she had reams of them, has deterred most Democratic candidates from issuing detailed proposals. Mr Biden, the front-runner, has two policies, including a cut-and-paste climate plan. Ms Warren apprehends that Mrs Clinton failed not because she had too many policies, but because she had no theme to make sense of them. Her commitment to saving capitalism from the capitalists is an answer to that.\n\nHer wonkishness also helps her deal with specific weaknesses. It has revised her former image as a one-trick pony, banging on about Wall Street. It has moderated her reputation as a left-winger. It has made Mr Sanders look lightweight by comparison. It has also helped neutralise an impression, exacerbated by sexism no doubt, that she is rather hectoring. \"She reminds me of my sister-in-law,\" said one of her listeners in New Hampshire guiltily. \"But she knows what she's talking about.\" Mrs Clinton's supporters were often unwilling to acknowledge her weaknesses as a campaigner. If Ms Warren's are more willing, it is because she also has strengths.\n\nShe may well supplant Mr Sanders as the main threat to Mr Biden from the left. Whether she could woo enough moderate voters to mount a serious challenge is harder to predict. It is certainly possible. Yet such voters are mainly concerned with beating Mr Trump, and may consider Ms Warren too left-wing for that, which would be reasonable. Or they might consider her too like Mrs Clinton, as a woman in her 60s, which would not be.\n\nThe sin of apostasy\n\nThat suggests Ms Warren's ideas may get less attention than they deserve on the left. Meanwhile they are being studied by reform-minded Republicans, grappling with the rejection of conservative verities that Mr Trump represents. Tucker Carlson of Fox News described Ms Warren's industrial policy as \"like Donald Trump at his best\". Senator Marco Rubio wrote a column applauding its aims, while concluding that a \"radical progressive movement\" would not fulfil them. This illustrates a paradoxical feature of the political divide: a combination of intellectual flux and partisan rigidity.\n\nDespite her past Republicanism, Ms Warren could not win votes on the right without repudiating her party in some way; by opposing mass immigration, for example. Yet her critique of American capitalism is quietly inspiring conservative thinkers. It is an odd time, when ideas cross parties more easily than people.",

            "body": "Okay, I'll bite.\n\n1. I find these arguments to be mostly sexist. I'm sorry if that hurts your feelings or something, but that's just how it reads most of the time. People who push these arguments tend to bring up minor incidents (a f\\*\\*\\*ing Instagram live video from December 2018 that got spread by Fox News?) and use dishonest interpretations of issues (how is Trump and his goons being racist a negative for Warren?). I think Warren is actually pretty fresh faced as a politician winning her first political office in 2012 and I do agree she has had some growing pains, but I think her leaning into being a progressive wonk is paying off. She was a professor at Harvard Law who's been praised constantly for how articulate and persuasive she is in discussing issues- it was what she did as a public figure before running for office being featured on shows like The Daily Show and Oprah.  In recent months, she's been able to connect her policy wonkness with her personal story like with the Universal Child Care and College Debt bills. I think it's all important to point out that I believe she connects with women very well in a way that I think men can miss sometimes and the 2018 primaries showed us how important women candidates and voters are in a post Trump political environment. There a ton a videos on this sub of Warren speaking but I'll share some of my favorites.\n   1. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRLdH4NCXqg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRLdH4NCXqg) \n   2.

And, honestly, you should watch at least one town hall of any candidate you're considering. \n2. I'll just share this podcast episode that basically encapsulates my views on the issue. I think it was a non-scandal that she tried to tackle early and, honestly, I think it has paid off however poorly you think she handled it then. It resulted in a slow start for her campaign but now that all the think pieces that could been written are done with she's been able to focus on policy and guide the media narrative by continuing to release policies at a steady rate. If it does come back up, it's just going to look really silly at this point. \n   1.  [https://seriouspod.com/sio162-in-defense-of-elizabeth-warren-2/](https://seriouspod.com/sio162-in-defense-of-elizabeth-warren-2/) \n3. Okay, here's some reading but I think we'll have to get into the details later to figure out your issues on some of this. \n   1. Trade -  [https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/06/04/elizabeth-warren-has-plan-nations-approach-trade/?utm\\_term=.2ec7c0eed521](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/06/04/elizabeth-warren-has-plan-nations-approach-trade/?utm_term=.2ec7c0eed521) ;  [https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/29/18118213/elizabeth-warren-trump-trade-gm-tariffs](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/29/18118213/elizabeth-warren-trump-trade-gm-tariffs) \n   2. I actually don't think the science is as clear as some try to make it out when it comes to nuclear energy. Warren supports the green new deal which kinda leaves nuclear still on the table. I just think there's still some research and debate left to figure out what we need to scale down and how quickly to preserve the planet -  [https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/energy/a26255413/green-new-deal-nuclear-power/](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/energy/a26255413/green-new-deal-nuclear-power/)  ;  [https://thebulletin.org/2019/02/why-the-green-new-deal-may-include-nuclear-power/](https://thebulletin.org/2019/02/why-the-green-new-deal-may-include-nuclear-power/) \n   3. I honestly couldn't care less about GMO labels. While I agree with you that they're stupid and only serve to perpetuate bad ideas, but, like, whatever? In fact there's research showing that mandatory labels may increase support of GMOs. All I can find is that Warren supported GMO labels in 2013 but, I mean, a lot of people did at the time. I'm sorry, I just don't have strong feelings about this topic in the scope of a presidential campaign focused on removing money politics and fixing our economy so it works for everyone. -  [https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/06/gmo-labeling-study/563699/](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/06/gmo-labeling-study/563699/) \n   4. When you're thinking about political candidates you need to focus on two things. First, what issue/s is most important to you and who do you think can most easily persuade to address those issues? Second, what issue do you think each candidate is going to fight for the hardest and which of those issues matters most to you? Personally, I think economic and political corruption are the most important issues to address if we are to accomplish anything on healthcare or climate change. Elizabeth Warren is the answer to both of those questions for me and I believe her track record proves that not only will she fight for these issue but she has the political know how to use the full strength of the executive branch to bring these ideas to fruition. She basically willed the CFPB ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer\\_Financial\\_Protection\\_Bureau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Financial_Protection_Bureau) ) into existence in 2011 without any elected position which has returned I think about $12 billion back to Americans from crooked corporations. Trumps administration and the Republican congress has tried to destroy it, but is unable to because of the way it was set up. Which is the other thing I like about Warren- she appears to be the most ready to get rough with republicans. She was the first candidate to support impeaching Trump, I still think one of the only candidates to support ending the Senate filibuster wholeheartedly, and I'm waiting to hear her expand on her thoughts on how to 'depoliticize' the supreme court. This shows me she's not here to play nice with Republicans like Obama hoped to do because we saw where that led. I believe we need someone who's committed to radical change and has a plan to make it happen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can clarify anything here. That was a lot of writing and I'm sure I messed something up here or there.",

The message I get is that the corporate (Republican) wing of the party -- the 3rd Way people, etc. -- hate Bernie so much that they are starting to see someone they are also opposed to in Warren as more palatable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWarren has been getting an awful lot of love lately, in editorial after editorial. That's great, because she deserves love and she'd make an excellent president. What's not great is that the support she's getting from right wing clowns like Jennifer Rubin and others is not genuine.  The support is cynical and tactical. It makes strategic sense to support her because Bernie is leading her and they think doing so eats into Bernie lead. I'm pretty certain that Warren wouldn't be getting this praise if Bernie wasn't in the race, or if Warren had a commanding lead on the field. I'm guessing you won't see establishment media lauding how Warren \"has a plan for that\" once she agrees to be Bernie's VP.",

To come all the way from a working class background, family almost losing their home as a child, then becoming a teacher, having a family, having children, going to law school, becoming a consumer advocate and harvard law professor, creating a governmental agency to protect americans from predatory banks and lenders, and then final becoming a US Senator is amazing. \n\nRight now my top two candidates are Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. I am supporting Elizabeth Warren as my top choice right now because I like the way she seamlessly weaves really good, detailed policy with values and fighting for big structural changes. Her Universal Child Care and student loan debt cancellation all paid for by the wealth tax would be amazing for me. Her supporting Medicare4All is also key for me, and I hope she releases a detailed health care plan to really seal the deal for why she is the best candidate.",

So my worry with Bernie is he will not make the best choices if they don't fit in with his particular ideology. For Elizabeth Warren, I trust that she not only has progressive values, but also the depth and detail of her policies tell me that she is thinking very carefully about the best ways to make big structural changes. \n\nI also think she's incredibly smart and persuasive. I think her working class background and her commitment not to take corporate money or have special meetings with large donors make her trustworthy.  More specifically to me, her policies for Universal Childcare and Student Loan Debt Cancellation would be literally life-changing for me.\n\nThat said, if Warren backtracks and doesn't strongly support Medicare4All, I will switch to Bernie. However, I am betting that she has another blockbuster plan in the works for Healthcare that she will probably release in the runup to the 1st DNC debate (topic is healthcare).",

            "body": "I think the lower-priority policies on his website are attempts to attract the support of niche groups and communities who rarely get their concerns highlighted in national politics, which makes Yang a populist and it\u2019s a valuable quality to have in the election. Elizabeth Warren I would also consider a populist. She focuses her policies on the poor, on parents, children, and those struggling with student debt. I think the unique problem Yang has gotten himself into is that the Freedom Dividend by design is a benefit for ALL people, which would make it tremendously beneficial for the society at whole, especially the poor, parents, children, and the indebted, but even so it makes it hard to market the idea as anti-poverty when its universality is its main feature. \n\nThe Freedom Dividend is certainly the most effective policy we could dream up to outright abolish poverty while getting a bunch of other great effects for our economy. It actually removes incentives not to work, since you get the Dividend whether or not you\u2019re poor, so it would be better for the whole. I find Warren\u2019s plan to be risky because it\u2019ll lock people into wasteful and ineffective government welfare programs that generate a culture of shame, cheating, and dependence. It would also be marvelous for reducing crime. The great thing about UBI is it doesn\u2019t fix anything other than poverty incredibly well, but it makes all other problems easier to fix because workers are no longer exploited by companies through their necessity for basic needs and families aren\u2019t stressed about future homelessness or hunger.\n\nYang has never talked about the constitutional amendment part of the Freedom Dividend. I wonder if he\u2019ll remove that from his website because he\u2019s also said it\u2019s unrealistic to use a constitutional amendment to \u201cget rid\u201d of the electoral college because we need 3/4ths of state legislatures to approve it. I agree that that is unserious policy. The sun-setting of old laws is also not the best in my view.",

The one area I think Bernie absolutely **dominates** where Warren doesn't, is with rhetoric. They both are offering tons of plans, but to me Bernie is the only candidate with a strong message of how it will all be executed. If you want to implement even a fraction of either Warren's or Bernie's plans you need a radical change in voter engagement in this country, and I have **never** seen a politician who can rally young people and apathetic people into the political process as well as Bernie has. In 2015 he was nothing but a small Independent Senator from Vermont, and he went on to win 23 contests against the establishment backed former First Lady, Secretary of State, and Senator of New York. Now he is arguably one of the most popular politicians in America, and he has changed the political rhetoric among leading Democrats. Just look at the incredibly influential organizations that stemmed out of his 2016 campaign:\n\n* [Justice Democrats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Democrats)\n\n* [Brand New Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_New_Congress)\n\n* [Our Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Revolution)\n\nBernie's central thesis to his entire political rhetoric is of revolution, of a movement... and he is right. We need big changes to address the existential crises of this country and frankly the entire planet. The only way we do that is if millions of people stand up and get involved in the political process.",

            "body": "Video of the Day \u2013 Elizabeth Warren Hurt America by Endorsing Hillary Clinton \n\n(via https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSEehau09l4)\n\nMichael Krieger &amp; H. A. Goodman  | Jun 11, 2016 \n\nDr. Jill Stein, the Green Party nominee for president, spoke on Democracy Now on Thursday. \n\nShe blasted Hillary Clinton for implementing many of the same policies that Trump is currently calling for, and expressed hope that Bernie Sanders will consider continuing his presidential run on a third-party ticket.\n\n\u201cTrump says very scary things \u2014 deporting immigrants, massive militarism and ignoring the climate. \n\nWell, Hillary, unfortunately, has a track record for doing all of those things,\u201d she added.\n\nClinton boasted at a town hall in New Hampshire in November 2015 that, as a senator, she had voted for 2006 legislation that authorized the building of roughly 650 miles of wall on the border.\u2013 From the post: Jill Stein of the Green Party \u2013 Clinton Helped Create Trump\n\n[https://libertyblitzkrieg.com/2016/06/09/jill-stein-of-the-green-party-clinton-helped-create-trump/]\n\nFirst, a bit of an introduction. I\u2019ve been following H. A. Goodman\u2019s work throughout much of the primary season. \n\nHe has been a passionate and determined fighter for Bernie Sanders for all the right reasons. \n\nAs such, I think what he has to say about Elizabeth Warren is representative of a significant portion of Sanders supporters.\n\nThe damage Elizabeth Warren has done to her reputation, as well as the overall movement to reign in Wall Street criminality, is impossible to overstate. \n\nShe went from instilling actual fear in the hearts of finance executives, to becoming a total joke. \n\nBy not endorsing Sanders and now rushing out to back Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Warren has taken herself completely out of the game and willingly transformed herself into Clinton\u2019s obedient progressive mascot.\n\nAs someone who worked on Wall Street for a decade, I can tell you all the bigwigs there are giddy with disbelief at how easily she was neutralized. \n\nThey will become emboldened by the fact that another tough talking politician was so easily brought in line and reduced to a laughing stock. Well done, Elizabeth Warren.\n\nNow here\u2019s the video.\n\nI\u2019d like to add a couple of things. \n\nFirst, to Mr. Goodman. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, but there\u2019s no big plan here. \n\nI know you don\u2019t actually think there is, but it\u2019s still sad to see you hold onto that hope. \n\nThe way I see it, there\u2019s only one obvious motivation behind Elizabeth Warren\u2019s actions:personal ambition.\n\nWhat is clear here is that Elizabeth Warren cares more about Elizabeth Warren than she does about her so-called principles. \n\nThere\u2019s no other way to justify endorsing someone who stands for everything she is supposedly against. \n\nI think the Democratic establishment likely promised to push her to the front of the line once Hillary sits on the throne, and she agreed. \n\nShe wants to be President, and she was also probably a little resentful than Bernie Sanders was able to get so far without \u201cplaying ball.\u201d \n\nThe whole affair is extraordinarily nauseating and Elizabeth Warren has exposed herself as a pathetic fake in front of the entire world.\n\nFinally, I want to end with some powerful words from Nina Turner, which Mr. Goodman mentioned at the beginning of his video blog.\n\nFrom RawStory:\n\n[http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/sanders-surrogate-blasts-elizabeth-warren-she-doesnt-get-brownie-points-for-slamming-trump/#.V1rqpJdcAQk.twitter]\n\nA top surrogate for Bernie Sanders isn\u2019t impressed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s attacks against Donald Trump, whom she frequently needles on Twitter and slams in speeches.\n\nNina Turner said she didn\u2019t think Warren could woo Sanders supporters if Hillary Clinton chose her as running mate, saying the Massachusetts senator hadn\u2019t done enough to help her colleague from Vermont during his primary campaign, reported The Hill.\n\n[http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/283003-sanders-surrogate-blasts-warren-you-dont-get-any-brownie]\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy for Democrats to attack Mr. Trump,\u201d said Nina Turner, the former state senator from Ohio. \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get any brownie points from me and other progressives for getting into a Twitter war with Mr. Donald Trump. That\u2019s easy. But when the fight was hard for Sen. Bernie Sanders, where was Sen. Warren?\u201d\n\nTurner said she and other Sanders supporters were disappointed that Warren, as one of the most high-profile progressive lawmakers, didn\u2019t campaign for the Democratic challenger.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re gonna attack me for saying this, but I\u2019m a truth-teller at this point,\u201d Turner said.\n\nAt least somebody has the guts to say it.\n\nArticle: http://libertyblitzkrieg.com/2016/06/11/video-of-the-day-elizabeth-warren-hurt-america-by-endorsing-hillary-clinton/",
