At 1.5B, he would have to give up $450M of his assets over 10 years, assuming he continuously increases an average of 3% of his wealth/year.  But he'd still be worth $1.5B after the tax and most likely would make a lot more money than 3%.",

That could have really changed things. I was only a kid when NAFTA passed, I wonder if the Democrats even attempted that. It always boggled my mind why Clinton would sign that agreement without anything to uplift American jobs and those around the world. It was all about corporate profits and cheap goods. It was fair to say that a lot of those American jobs wouldn't be coming back, but it just feels like a Democrat President would have done more. \n\n!WarrenPlanBot trade",

This style of questioning is helpful for outlining an approach but each situation has a million unique variables, some of which are hidden from the public. \n\nIn a broader sense; I think we make a mistake when we separate foreign and domestic policy. Problems overseas are only overseas until  they aren\u2019t. (The deterioration in the Northern Triangle countries over the last several years is what\u2019s causing our immigration influx now.) We\u2019ve been using the military as the main driver of American interests abroad and that\u2019s no good for anyone. Diplomacy is a much better investment than bombs. It seems like Warren gets that.\n\nFurther reading: !WarrenPlanBot Rebuilding the state department.",
