This style of questioning is helpful for outlining an approach but each situation has a million unique variables, some of which are hidden from the public. \n\nIn a broader sense; I think we make a mistake when we separate foreign and domestic policy. Problems overseas are only overseas until  they aren\u2019t. (The deterioration in the Northern Triangle countries over the last several years is what\u2019s causing our immigration influx now.) We\u2019ve been using the military as the main driver of American interests abroad and that\u2019s no good for anyone. Diplomacy is a much better investment than bombs. It seems like Warren gets that.\n\nFurther reading: !WarrenPlanBot Rebuilding the state department.",
